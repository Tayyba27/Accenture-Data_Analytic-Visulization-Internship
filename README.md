Delve into the dynamic world of data analytics and visualisation with the Navigating Numbers virtual internship.
This immersive programme offers an in-depth exploration of data essentials, encompassing data cleaning, modelling, visualisation, and storytelling.

# Task 1: Project Understanding
Social Buzz is a rapidly expanding technology unicorn in need of swift adaptation to its large-scale global operations.
Quickly get up to speed with the business problem being addressed, project requirements, and team alignment.

Read the brief from Social Buzz to:

1) Understand the client and business problem at hand.
2) Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
3) Identify which tasks to focus on as a data analyst.
4)

# Task 2
Often, you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
After analysis, we got data sets needed to complete the analysis:
Reaction Score (the score is used to quantify popularity)
- Content ID
- Reaction Types
- Content type
- Category
# Data Cleaning:
Clean the data by:
removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns that are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
The end result will be three cleaned data sets:

- Reaction Types
- Reactions
- Content
-

# Data Modelling:
Create a final data set by merging 3 tables

A cleaned dataset
Top 5 categories
Cleaned Data set:
So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning : Cleaned Dataset
